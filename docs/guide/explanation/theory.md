# The theory behind this guide


## Introduction

The technical documentation good practices could be divided into 2 main groups: *HOW TO WRITE* and *WHAT TO WRITE*.

The How to Write is based on language structure and how to use it correctly to maximize audience understanding.

The What to Write is based on techniques, layouts and good practices to know what to add in each documentation and for what audience.

This document will divide the Documentation into 6 major topics and will describe actions for each one of them in order to improve the knowledge and the tools that MercadoLibre uses.

The topics are based on this [guide](https://thebestschools.org/resources/how-to-write-research-paper/).

## Audience Definition
> What to Write

### Definition
The documentation can be used by many developers with different experience levels and different knowledge in the product. A detailed description of each aspect of the system can help a member of the team but it is not useful for a developer of another area that only wants to know how to use the tool.

The goal of this topic is to define what type of different audiences the Documentation Service has and define What to Write for each one of these. For that Documentation Service may create different types of documents and styles.

### Features
- Define the audience;

### Challenges
- Identify audiences;
- Group similar audiences in one single persona;

---
## Structure Definition
> What to Write

### Definition
Each audience will require different information and a style and structure definition is important to know what each documentation must have and what must not have. Style is about the content and convention, structure is about the order of the content.

### Features
- Define the style needed for each audience;
- Define the structure of each type of documentation;
- Define the style allowing the expansion of the content when necessary;

### Challenges
- How to work with possible overlap of content in different styles;

---
## Layout
> What to Write

### Definition
Layout is not only about being pretty. It is about being clear and understandable.

Defining the correct layout for each type of documentation is crucial to improve the quality and consistency of the material created.

While the structure is based on the content and markdown, the layout is based on the published content.

### Features
- Define the layout for each documentation;
- Define visual markers for groups of related documents (i.e. Services of Fury; Tools of Fury; MP Apis)

### Challenges
- Choose the right layout;
- Choose a tool that allows to change and update the layout;

---
## Guide the content
> How to Write

### Definition
The content itself is part of the WHAT TO WRITE group but the documentation service will assume that the writer has mastered the subject and the style created will help to organize the ideas.

The goal of this topic is to help the writer how to write each part of the documentation to guarantee a clear understanding by the audience.

### Features
- Write a guideline of how to write that style;
- Write a quick guide with do and don't;
- Provide simple notation to help the writer to create code examples
- Provide simple notation to images and inline diagrams

### Challenges
- Write a guide clean and simple;
- Write a guide without many rules;
- Create a evolutionary design the allows to add notations more notations in future releases;

---
## Planning, Write and Review
>How to Write

### Definition
Planning should be the most important part of writing documentation. The documentation service must encourage and give tools to allow the writer to plan and gather all necessary information before starting writing.

Reviewing the documentation in an incremental way with the rest of the team is also important and must be easy to do.

### Features
- Write a guide of the most common tasks to do before writing (i.e. discover the most common scenarios, create snippets for common cases; list rules and limitations of the tools);
- Integrate documentation with APIs of spell checking;
- Write a guide explaining how, when and what to review;

### Challenges
- Discover how to integrate with the API;
- Discover how to make the review easier;

---
## Writing Techniques
> How to Write

### Definition
The use of global english, active voices, avoiding time related information and other techniques will improve the clarity of the documentation and is an important part of the art of tech writing.

### Features
- Write a guide with the best practices;
- Create a cheat sheet with examples;
- Guide the writers to external materials;

### Challenges
- Think how the course could be created;
- Capture the best practices in one document;
