# Write in global english

English is an international language. Writing technical documents in English allows them to be broadly read and shared. However, many readers will be non-native speakers.

To accommodate all readers, use Global English. This style of English is logical and literal which makes it more easily understood. In addition, writing globally means being aware of content that can be difficult to understand or simply misunderstood. For example, avoiding idioms and the subjunctive, as well as being careful with words that can be both a noun and verb.
