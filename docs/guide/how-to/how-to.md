# How-to write how-to guides

A how-to guide is like a recipe. It serves a specific purpose and expects the user to have some experience to do that action.


### Describe a sequence of actions
A how-to guide contains a sequence of actions, that have an order.

### Solve a problem
The problem or task is the concenr of a how-to guide: stick to that practical goal.

### Do not explain concepts
A how-to guide should not try to explain things, keeep the practical aspect. If explanation are important, link to them.

### Be flexible
A tutorial needs to be didactic in nature, but a how-to guide needs to be adaptable to real-world use-cases. A how-to guide that is useless for any purpose except exactly the narrow one you have addressed is rarely valuable.

### Omit the unnecessary
Programmer loves explaining things, a how-to guide should not try to explain things. Practical usability is more helpful than completeness

### Pay attention to naming

Choose titles that say exactly what a how-to guide shows.

- good: *How to integrate application performance monitoring*
- bad: *Integrating application performance monitoring* (maybe the document is about how to decide whether you should, not about how to do it)
- very bad: *Application performance monitoring* (maybe it’s about how - but maybe it’s about whether, or even just an explanation of what it is)
